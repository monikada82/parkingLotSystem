#  Parking Lot System (Java OOP Project)

A beginner-friendly **Low-Level Design (LLD)** project implemented in **Java** using clean **Object-Oriented Programming** principles.  
This project simulates a multi-level parking lot that supports different types of vehicles and parking slot sizes.

##  Features:

- Multi-level parking support  
- Vehicle types:
  - Bike
  - Car
  - Truck

- Compatibility rules:
  - Bike → Small/Medium/Large
  - Car → Medium/Large
  - Truck → Large
- Ticket generation with timestamp  
- Parking status display  
- Simple & clean OOP design  

##  Low-Level Design (LLD) Concepts Used

- Classes & Objects  
- Inheritance (Bike, Car, Truck → Vehicle)  
- Enums (VehicleType, SlotType)  
- Composition (Level → ParkingSlots)  
- Encapsulation  
- Clean separation of models & services  
- O(1) slot lookup using HashMap
